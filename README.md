# HTML
## Elements
Elements are the central piece to HTML that lets us make different modifications to the things we show on screen. For example, 
they allow you to display headings of different sizes, add images, and move these components around the screen. Most elements consist of an opening tag, a closing tag, and potentially some text in between like <div> and <h1>. Some elements only need an opening tag, like <img>.
