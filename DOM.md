# The Document Object Model (DOM)
How is an HTML (or XML) document treated when we try to incorporate JavaScript to it? 
This is done through the DOM interface where these documents can be interpreted as a tree structure!

## Why is it called the DOM? Document? Object? Model? 
Each word in the DOM can be thought of as the following: 

Document - Refers to the entire document (ex: the .html file) 
Object - Every element inside the document is considered an "object" 
Model - The system in which these objects are placed in the hierarchial structure

## Why is the DOM important? What does it allow you to do?
