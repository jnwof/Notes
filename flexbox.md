# Flexbox
Flexbox allows you to arrange items in rows or columns in a more easier and dynamic way. 

## Setting up the flexbox 
To use the flexbox model, the parent element of all the other elements you want to arrange needs to be transformed into a flex container. 
This is done by changing the display value of the parent element to:

```
parent {
  display: flex;
}
```
Once this is done, the children (all elements inside the parent flex container) will be affected when changing the flex attributes.
